# CM122

Designed for engineering students as well as students from biological sciences and medical school. Development and application of computational approaches to biological questions, with focus on formulating interdisciplinary problems as computational problems and then solving these problems using algorithmic techniques. Computational techniques include those from statistics and computer science.

Course Learning Objectives
>Upon completing the course, you will be able to formulate biological problems as algorithmic problems and have an advanced background in applied data structures and algorithms. You will also gain experience in implementing software that can scale to large datasets.

Above are all the projects I completed for the UCLA course, CM122, in Spring 2023 taught by Professor Eleazar Eskin and Professor Jason Ernst
